Where do i start.

This assignment has broke me in many ways.

The code that you are going to look at is compilable, with no known errors. 
But deep down there is an issue, i am sure of it, because it will not work. 

I have tried to fix it in multiple ways, but at this point I cant even think properly. Basic coding fails me even.
i couldnet even point to what fixes i have performed, changed or improved/made worse at this point. It makes me sick. 

you can successfully run make to compile the program! yay! :)
You have to use ./slm to "run" the program. I could not manage to make slm only to work.

The code is found in the folder src, where you find languagemodel.cpp, languagemodel.h, generatetext.cpp and generatetext.h.

I am sorry.
